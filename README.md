# Data Analysis Project on Sample Superstore Dataset

This project involves a detailed analysis of the Sample Superstore dataset to uncover business insights such as sales trends, profit margins, and customer segmentation. The analysis was performed using Python, with the help of libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Objectives
1. DataPreparation
     1. LoadthedatasetintoaPandasDataFrame.
     2. DisplaythefirstfewrowsoftheDataFrametounderstanditsstructure.
     3. Checkformissingvaluesandhandlethemappropriately.
     4. Removeanyduplicaterowsifpresent.
2. Data cleaning
     1. converst the postal code into string data type
     2. extact the city state into new column called location by concatinating bothe the colum   
3. Data Analysis
     1. Calculate the total sales, total profit ,and average discount for each year.
     2. Identify the top 10 products by sales.
     3. Determine the region with the highest profit.
     4. Analyze the sales and profit by product category and sub-category.  
4. Data visualization
     1. Perform a correlation analysis between numerical columns.
     2. Use a pivot table to summarize sales and profit by region and customer segment.
     3. Identify any outliers in the sales data using box plots.
5. Advanced Analysis
     1. Create a bar chart to show the total sales by year.
     2. Plot a line graph showing the monthly sales trend.
     3. Generate a pie chart to visualize the proportion of sales by region.
     4. Create a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between sales and profit.
